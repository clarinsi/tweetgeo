# The filtering and extraction module of GeoTweet

Requirements:
python2.7*

## Filtering

For filtering edit the ```filtering.py``` script. For now, filtering by language only is pre-enabled.

## Extraction

Edit ```config.py``` and set the output TSV file path and functions whose results should be included in the TSV file. Notice that twitter ID, username, longitude, latitude and text of the tweet are always included.

The ```"``` quotation mark is used for quoting in the TSV file.
